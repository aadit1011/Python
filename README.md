  Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
  Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented, and functional       programming.   It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
